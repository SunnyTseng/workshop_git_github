Download and install Git in your computer. The software can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/). 

#### 2. Register a Github account

Create a GitHub account on the [Github website](https://github.com/). 

#### 3. Link RStudio with Git/Github

 [Here](https://rcdsdocs.it.northwestern.edu/tutorials/r/git-with-r.html) is a online tutorial. Follow instructions from **Connect RStudio and Git** to **Linking to GitHub**.
